    <p>1) Define each of the following.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>entry/datum</b>: an item contained inside of a node</li>
      <li><b>node</b>: a single "circle" or vertex in a tree that
      contains a item (the node is the container, the datum is the
      item inside that container).</li>
      <li><b>child</b>: a node that has a parent (i.e. a node that
      branches off from another node)</li>
      <li><b>parent</b>: a node that has at least one child (i.e. a 
      node that has other nodes branching off from it)</li>
      <li><b>leaf</b>: a node that has no children (has no other nodes
      branching off underneath it)</li>
      <li><b>forest</b>: one or more trees</li>
      <li><b>binary tree</b>: a type of tree that satisfies the
      following conditions</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Each node can have at most 2 children, called a left and a
        right</li>
        <li>Every element in the subtree to the left of the node must
        be smaller than the element in the node</li>
        <li>Every element in the subtree to the right of the node must
        be larger than the element in the node</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>2) Which of the following are valid <tt>Tree</tt> 
    constructors?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tree() <b>Invalid</b>: trees <i>must</i> contain at least
      one element, its datum.</li>
      <li>Tree(3) <b>Valid</b>: this constructs a leaf with 3 as its
      entry (notice that our implementation gives a default value for
      <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt>)</li>
      <li>Tree(5, Tree(1), Tree(5)) <b>Valid</b>: this constructs
      a tree whose datum is 5, and has two children whose elements are
      1 and 5.</li>
      <li>Tree(4, Tree(2)) <b>Valid</b>: This is a Tree that does not
      have a right child</li>
      <li>Tree(2, Tree(2, 4, 5)) <b>Invalid</b>: the 2nd and 3rd 
      argument to a Tree constructor must be other Trees</li>
    </ol>

    <p>3) Draw a graphical representation of the tree (ignore the
    leading 0s).</p>

      <li>25</li>
      <li>9, 20, 27</li>
      <li>2 children</li>

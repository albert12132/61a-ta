Example App
===========

This directory contains a skeleton for a new app. Rewrite this README
to explain the app.

Every app requires the following:

* `__init__`: allows the compiler to acces content files in this
  directory as Python modules
* `Makefile`: configure this for more user friendly compiler interface
* `templates`: a directory that houses templates for this app

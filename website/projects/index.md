In preparation for co-lecturing CS 61A in summer 2015, I redesigned the
[class's website](http://su15.cs61a.org) using
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to improve responsiveness.  With
students' ease-of-use in mind, I added

* fixed sidebars on assignment pages for easier navigation
* an auto-updating quick-links section on the home page for fast access to
  upcoming assignments.
* a resource search bar that queries by resource name, type, and topic

<item ok-client https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/ok-client>

In Fall 2014, CS 61A developed an autograding system called
[OK](https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/ok). I led development on the
student-facing command-line autograding script called
[ok-client](https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/ok-client), which features

* autograding to test correctness for programming assignments in the Python3
  programming language
* an "unlocking mechanism" in which students answer questions to "unlock"
  autograder tests before the tests can be used for correctness testing. You
  can read more about the idea in [this
  paper](/public/pubs/las15-unlocking.pdf).
* collection of student usage statistics, which are aggregated and stored on
  OK's servers. This data is used for CS education research.

<item Templar https://github.com/albert12132/templar>

CS 61A reuses material from semester to semester, but with some differences due
to scheduling changes.  To address this, I wrote
[Templar](https://github.com/albert12132/templar), which features

* a Markdown-to-HTML converter, so that course material could be written with
  little markup overhead
* a plain-text linker, so existing resources can be reused without the
  need of duplication between semesters
* a static templating engine that supports template inheritance and embedded
  Python, to build a consistent front-end while minimizing code repetition

I also use Templar to generate this website.

<item albertwu.org https://github.com/albert12132/albertwu.org>

My personal website. From Summer 2012 to Summer 2015, my website was primarily
used to host CS 61A-related practice problems and notes that I wrote over the
years.  The code I originally used to generate my website was the predecessor
of Templar (I now use Templar to build my website).

If you've seen my website before, you may have noticed I recently redesigned it!

<item Tweetbot https://github.com/albert12132/tweetbot>

A Twitter bot that I built with my good friend Brian for a quick hackathon. If
you tweet to
[@TweetLikeMeBot](https://twitter.com/TweetLikeMeBot/with_replies), our bot
replies with random message crafted from your most recent tweets. You can also
ask @TweetLikeMeBot to tweet someone directly at
[tweetbot.herokuapp.com/](http://tweetbot.herokuapp.com/).

Tweetbot is written with [node.js][] and the [Twitter
API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api). The messages are generated by
sampling from a Markov model of bigrams of previous tweets.

<item java2python https://github.com/albert12132/java2python>

A web-based Java-to-Python3 compiler that I wrote as a learning exercise. I
experimented with [node.js][] web development, CSS, and JavaScript. The
compiler supports a subset of Java syntax.

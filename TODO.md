Topics

Projects and Homeworks
======================

* If you use pastebin, make sure to set "unlisted"
* explain grading policy
    * homeworks
        * based on "effort"
        * subjective, but better (for students) than grading solely on
          correctness
    * explaining the autograder (maybe just a piazza post)
        * there to help you catch bugs
        * help you test edge cases
        * won't have such a mechanism in future classes/real world
            * should get you in habit of thinking of edge cases/making
              sure code actually works

Exams
=====

* More straightforward environment diagrams
* Questions that are more reflective of real world problems
* Always try to test "big picture" ideas

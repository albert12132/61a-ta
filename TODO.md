Course Design
=============

* The purpose of 61A:
    1. **Teach problem solving skills** for computer science
        * Construction of algorithms: how do we arrive at the
          solution?
        * Analysis of algorithms
    2. Teach language-agnostic computer science concepts
        * Data structures (Rlists, Trees, lists, dictionaries)
        * Abstraction, OOP
        * Don't focus too much on language features: introduce
          language-specific features with motivation of solving a
          specific dilemma
        * introduction to special topics
    3. Teach coding
        * Debugging skills
        * Coding style
        * Secondary goal: learn language-specific features
* Midterm 1:
    * release a mock exam before first midterm to get students
      accustomed to exam style

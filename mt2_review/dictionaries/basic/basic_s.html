    <p>1) Any <i>immutable</i> object can be used as a key -- this
    includes numbers, strings, and tuples. Mutable objects, such as
    lists and dictionaries, are not allowed to be used as keys.</p>

    <p>2) A single key can only map on to one value. That value can,
    however, be a sequence like a tuple or a list, so you can
    effectively map to multiple things (but it still only counts as
    one value).</p>

    <p>3) Python dictionaries are not ordered. If you were to iterate
    through the dictionnary, the order in which you iterate through
    them is not necessarily the order in which you added them.</p>
